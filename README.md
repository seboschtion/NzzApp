# NZZ App

This is an unofficial "Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung" reader for Windows 10 (currently only mobile) devices. Everyone is welcome to contribute! When a new version is ready, I will upload it to the Windows Store.

## Dependencies
When you clone this app, you have to install the SQLite extension from the extensions folder. You should also clone the SebastianToolkit, the NzzApp uses a few helpers from it.

## How to contribute
I prefer the use of the Git Flow model. Create a branch named "feature/[Featurename, Bugname, ...]" and create the pull request based on that branch. You can (and I'd like you to) add your name to the credentials table in the SettingsView. Feel free to add a Twitter/... account, too! When the time is right, I will build a new appx-Package and update the app in the store.

## Copyright
As noted in the app, the content belongs to the NZZ group from Switzerland. Please do not misuse the data we receive through the API, otherwise we'll soon have to deal with new or more secured API's.

## Thank you...
... for contributing, every addition or fix is very welcome :-)
